name: context-loader
description: Auto-loads the bencium-harness project memory at the start of every session. Triggers when the cwd contains a .harness/ folder. Reads .harness/memory.md, .harness/rules.md, and the last 3 entries in .harness/archive/ to restore project context across /clear and session boundaries.

# context-loader

## When to invoke

At the start of any session (or when explicitly asked to refresh context) IF the current working directory contains a `.harness/` folder.

You should also invoke this skill whenever:

- The user runs `/clear` and you need to re-establish project context.
- The user asks "what was the context?" or "where were we?" and a `.harness/` exists.
- You're about to make an architectural recommendation and want to check existing decisions first.

## What to do

1. Verify `.harness/` exists in the project root. If not, do nothing — this is not a bencium-harness project.

2. Read these files (in this order):
   - `CLAUDE.md` (project root) — pointer file. Skim only; the detailed files it points to are the authoritative source. Skip if absent.
   - `.harness/memory.md` — hot context. Read in full.
   - `.harness/conventions.md` — code-quality rules the agent must follow on every task. Read in full. If missing, note "no conventions.md — running without quality guardrails" internally.
   - `.harness/rules.md` — non-negotiables. Read in full.
   - `.harness/constraints.md` — hard limits. Read if non-empty.
   - The most recent 3 entries in `.harness/archive/` — find by `ls .harness/archive/ | sort -r | head -3`. Read each in full.
   - `tasks.md` (project root) — read the `## Now` section only.
   - `ACCEPTANCE.md` (project root) — read all unchecked items.

3. Internally summarize what you learned. Do NOT print the summary to the user unless they ask — this is context for YOU.

4. If you find anything in memory or recent archive that directly contradicts what the user just asked, surface it: "Heads up: a decision in archive/NNNN says X — does this still apply, or has it changed?"

## What NOT to do

- Do not load this if `.harness/` doesn't exist. Stay silent.
- Do not load this on every prompt. Once per session is enough unless the user explicitly asks to refresh.
- Do not dump the memory file contents into the chat. Use it as context.
- Do not modify any files when loading context. This is read-only.
