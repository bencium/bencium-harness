# Changelog

Release codenames follow the format `<Month> <Theme>` (e.g. "May Gate"). They're the human-friendly identifier — refer to releases by codename in conversation. SemVer numbers stay in `plugin.json` / `marketplace.json` for Claude Code's plugin manager only.

Theme vocabulary (pick one when cutting a release):
**Foundations** (scaffold/restructure), **Gate** (approval/quality gate), **Polish** (UX/cosmetic), **Hardening** (security/validation), **Loop** (build-loop flow changes), **Memory** (memory.md changes), **Compass** (clarity/observability), **Bridge** (integration), **Lantern** (debugging/transparency), **Anchor** (backwards-compat/stability).

## Jun Hardening — v0.6.0 (2026-06-03)

Adopts the highest-value lessons from Anthropic's *Harness design for long-running application development* (Mar 2026) that the harness wasn't yet using. The article's central finding — an agent grading its own work skews positive, and *separation* is the strongest fix — exposed that `/bencium-verify` ran in the builder's own context. This release closes the self-evaluation gap and hardens green-means-shipped. **No new commands** (count stays 9): the verification changes are internal steps, and the context-handoff lesson is carried by the existing nudge points rather than a new command — keeping with the article's own "strip pieces no longer load-bearing" principle.

### Added
- **Independent evaluator in `/bencium-verify` (Step 3b).** When verify runs in the same session that built the feature — or for subjective rows easy to rationalize — it now delegates a skeptical second opinion to a `Task` subagent that did NOT write the code ("default to FAIL when evidence is thin"), reconciling to the stricter verdict. Bounded by the hard 3-agent cap (one verifier is the norm). Directly adopts the article's single biggest lever: *separating the agent doing the work from the agent judging it.* `Task` added to `/bencium-verify` `allowed-tools`.
- **Gamed-test / reward-hacking inspection in `/bencium-verify` (Step 3a).** Before trusting any green check, verify inspects the test/config diff for weakened or skipped assertions, hardcoded echo values, tests edited to fit the code, blind snapshot updates, and scope-narrowed `verify.cmd`. A gamed pass is recorded as FAIL with file:line evidence regardless of the green result. Addresses the article's warning that agents optimize for the metric they're graded on.
- **`## Session handoff` block in `memory.md.tmpl`.** A volatile, overwrite-in-place slot for "where we are right now" (active task · up next · blockers · uncommitted files). The existing `next-moves.md.tmpl` "Token checkpoint" nudge now tells the agent to refresh it before `/clear`/compaction when stopping mid-task, and `context-loader` treats it as the most recent state on SessionStart. This is the article's "context resets need a handoff artifact with enough state to pick up cleanly" — carried by existing systems, not a new command. (Considered a dedicated `/bencium-checkpoint` command and rejected it as surface-area bloat: native compaction + `context-loader` already cover most of it.)

### Hard rules added
- `/bencium-verify`: a gamed pass is a FAIL (green is necessary, not sufficient — the test must still assert the real behavior); prefer Step 3b separation on self-authored work and take the stricter verdict unless it can be refuted with concrete evidence.

### Fixed
- `marketplace.json` plugin `version` was stale at `0.2.0`; bumped to `0.6.0` to match `plugin.json`.

### Considered, not included
- A dedicated `/bencium-checkpoint` command (folded into the handoff nudge above instead).
- A standalone `/bencium-review` fresh-context code reviewer (sibling of the Step 3b evaluator) — available on request.

## Jun Lantern — v0.5.0 (2026-05-29)

Makes harness reports legible to downstream automation, sharpens the project-rules scaffold, and surfaces the "ordering invariant" pattern as a first-class concept. The harness now signals state in machine-readable form at every loop boundary so CI scripts, dashboards, and follow-up commands can consume it directly without scraping prose.

### Added
- **Machine-readable marker JSON blocks** at the end of `/bencium-verify` (Step 8), `/bencium-deploy` Step 5.5 SMOKE, `/bencium-deploy` Step 6 full success, and `/bencium-retro` Step 5. Each marker is a fenced ```` ```json ```` block emitted as the **last** output of its step (nothing after the closing fence). Schema version `1`, all share `_marker` / `version` / `ts` / `phase` fields. The four marker names: `bencium-verify-result` (hard checks + local soft checks + deferred-to-smoke), `bencium-smoke-result` (deploy URL + sha + per-row result against the live URL), `bencium-deploy-result` (sha + target + health + smoke summary), `bencium-retro-result` (retro id + archive path + trigger + root cause + the three permanent-upgrade proposals). Unlocks CI integration, deploy gates, "fix the findings" follow-up patterns, and status badges — without any tool shipping. Document the marker contract in README "Machine-readable markers" section.
- **"Ordering invariants" section in `conventions.md.tmpl`.** Names the harness's four encoded invariants (PLAN→BUILD, RED→GREEN, VERIFY→DEPLOY, DEPLOY→SMOKE) and explains the pattern so users can declare their own project-specific invariants in `.harness/rules.md` (migration before seed, auth before routes, etc.). Document the *why* on each invariant — without rationale, the agent guesses and may permit clever-but-wrong shortcuts.

### Changed
- **`rules.md.tmpl` re-scaffolded** with DO / DO NOT / Ordering-invariants three-section structure. Replaces the prior flowing-bullet examples. `(example)` prefix on every seed bullet lets the user grep-delete the scaffolding without rereading the file. Sharper format, easier to enforce per turn.

### Hard rules added
- `/bencium-verify`, `/bencium-deploy`, `/bencium-retro`: the marker block MUST be the last output of its step (nothing after the closing fence). Markers report state, not opinion — no recommendations inside the JSON. Schema is versioned (`version: 1`); future changes bump the integer.

## Jun Compass — v0.4.0 (2026-05-28)

Closes the three Level-1 harness gaps named by the "model + harness" worldview: retro can now propose **hooks**, not just docs; the conventions template treats **LSP diagnostics** as a pre-edit check; and brownfield `/bencium-init` uses **parallel Explore subagents** (3-agent cap) to map large unfamiliar repos without bloating the main context. Every mistake becomes a permanent upgrade — now at the hook layer, not only the doc layer.

### Added
- **Retro proposes a hook (Step 4b in `/bencium-retro`).** When the root cause is a destructive op (`rm -rf`, force-push, schema drop), a repeated detectable mistake (`SELECT *`, banned import path), an env-dependent quirk that costs more to verify than to block, or an explicit user request, the retro drafts a `.harness/hooks/NNNN-<slug>.sh` script + a `<project>/.claude/settings.json` wiring snippet, asks approval, then writes the script and logs the new `## Hooks added` line to `memory.md`. Hooks live in `.harness/hooks/` and ARE committed (project policy, like `ACCEPTANCE.md`). The harness never mutates `settings.json` directly — user pastes the snippet. Decision rule is load-bearing: hooks are reserved for the four classes above; ACCEPTANCE rows remain the default permanent-upgrade vehicle.
- **LSP pre-edit check in `conventions.md.tmpl`.** New section between "Stack defaults" and "Token-cost discipline" instructs the agent to read language-server diagnostics for the file before editing it (tsserver/ts for TS/JS, pyright + ruff for Python, gopls for Go, rust-analyzer for Rust). Auto-loaded by `context-loader` each session, so the rule reaches every `/bencium-next` plan without new plumbing. Prevents the "agent wrote code that doesn't compile" failure class up front rather than at verify time.
- **Parallel Explore subagents in `/bencium-init` brownfield discovery.** Step 2 now tiers: small/focused repos (<500 tracked files, no `src/`+`app/`+`packages/` combo) keep the sequential reads; large/unfamiliar repos spawn three Explore subagents in parallel — structure (entry points, build config, layout), data layer (DB schemas, API surface, env-var inventory), tests + CI (framework, coverage, existing quality gates). Each returns a 5-10 bullet report; main context synthesizes. `Task` added to `/bencium-init` `allowed-tools`. The 3-agent cap is hard — a fourth area gets folded into one of the three, never spawned.

### Changed
- `/bencium-retro` Step 5 confirmation now includes a `✚ Hook:` line alongside the existing `📝 Memory:` and `✅ Acceptance:` lines, so the user sees all three permanent-upgrade vehicles in one print block.
- `/bencium-retro` hard rules now name the four hook-warranting cause classes explicitly and forbid `settings.json` mutation by the plugin.
- `/bencium-init` hard rules now forbid spawning Explore subagents for greenfield init or small brownfield repos (latency for no signal) and reiterate the 3-agent cap.

## Jun Gate — v0.3.0 (2026-05-27)

Closed the false-confirmation gap that let local-pass features get marked shipped without ever being verified on the deployed env, added the token-checkpoint and close-the-loop advisories, and added a persistent Claude Code statusline plus AskUserQuestion portability so the same command prompts work outside Claude Code. The harness now refuses to confuse "passes on my machine" with "deployed and working" — and the loop's current phase is visible at all times.

### Added
- **Token checkpoint advisory** — `next-moves.md.tmpl` now ends with a 💡 block nudging `/clear` and naming exactly what `context-loader` restores on SessionStart (`.harness/memory.md`, `rules.md`, `conventions.md`, last 3 archive entries, `## Now`, unchecked `ACCEPTANCE.md`). Rendered at every natural loop boundary: `/bencium-verify` (PASS or FAIL), `/bencium-retro`, `/bencium-deploy` success (Step 6 now renders the template), and `/bencium-promote` after Mode 1 task promotion (Mode 2 memory demotion is intentionally exempt — it's housekeeping, not a slice boundary).
- **Close-the-loop guidance after BUILD** — `/bencium-next` Step 4 (BUILD success) now renders `next-moves.md.tmpl` instead of printing a one-line `Next:` hint. The `{{tail_status}}` slot carries an explicit 🔁 line walking the user through `/bencium-verify → /bencium-retro → memory.md → /clear`, so the loop-closing sequence (and where learnings get banked) is visible at every BUILD-end rather than implied.
- **Statusline script** at `bencium-harness/statusline/harness-status.sh` — two-row Claude Code status bar showing the phase-progress strip (current phase wrapped in `[ ]`), project name from `.harness/memory.md`, current task, `## Now` count, ACCEPTANCE ratio, model display name, session cost, and context-window %. Pure bash + awk + grep, <50ms per render, silent outside harness projects. Plugins cannot register statuslines declaratively, so the install snippet for `~/.claude/settings.json` is in `INSTALL.md` under "Statusline (optional)".
- **`.harness/state` phase file** written by every `/bencium-*` command on entry (except `/bencium-decide`, which is meta and leaves prior phase intact). Format: `phase=<roadmap|plan|build|test|deploy|smoke|reflect>\ntask=<title>\nupdated=<iso8601>`. Used by the statusline; ignored by `context-loader` (agent already knows its phase from the running command). Templated `README.md.tmpl` now recommends adding `.harness/state` to `.gitignore`.
- **`Bash` added to `/bencium-feature` allowed-tools** so it can write `.harness/state` alongside its existing Read/Edit/AskUserQuestion permissions.
- **`AskUserQuestion` portability note** in `/bencium-init` Step 3, `/bencium-feature` Step 4, and `/bencium-rollback` Step 3 — the three commands that use the Claude Code-only `AskUserQuestion` tool. Each prompt now instructs the agent to use `AskUserQuestion` if available (Claude Code) and otherwise ask inline as a numbered list (claude.ai, Cursor, Codex). Same prompt works in any host without manual edits.
- **TDD red→green hard gate in `/bencium-next` BUILD phase.** Phase A plan template now REQUIRES `Failing test (red):` and `Deployed-env check (smoke):` fields. Phase B Step 4.0 RED writes the declared test, runs it, observes failure for the expected reason — implementation editing is blocked until red is seen. Step 4.2 confirms green after implementation. Bypass requires `none — trivial (declared)` or explicit `skip tdd` + justification logged to `.harness/memory.md ## TDD bypasses`.
- **`🔥 SMOKE` phase** in `phase-banner` skill (bright magenta `\033[95m`), wired into the loop strip as `🗺️ ▸ 📋 ▸ 🔨 ▸ ✓ ▸ 🚀 ▸ 🔥 ▸ 💭`.
- **Step 5.5 SMOKE in `/bencium-deploy`** — after health check, re-walks every `[deployed]`-tagged ACCEPTANCE row against `deploy.url` with real HTTP. Any FAIL → memory line `DEPLOYED BUT SMOKE FAILED <sha>`, auto-invoke `/bencium-retro` with `trigger=smoke-fail`, offer rollback. Only SMOKE may mark `[deployed]` rows `[x]`.
- **`deploy.url` config key** in `.harness/config.yaml`. `/bencium-deploy` refuses to run if `deploy.url` is missing while `[deployed]` rows exist — silent-skip is the failure mode this release was built to prevent.
- **`[deployed]` tag convention** in `ACCEPTANCE.md` — items tagged this way are skipped by `/bencium-verify` (reported as DEFERRED-TO-SMOKE) and re-walked by SMOKE.
- **UI-disclosure convention** in `.harness/conventions.md` and a matching ACCEPTANCE row — every async action must surface loading / progress / error in the UI. Silent fetches, console-only errors, and unannotated long-running work are now first-class quality bugs.
- **Landing page (`site/index.html`)** refreshed: new hero copy, 7-phase loop strip including SMOKE card, decisions terminal rows for TDD gate and deployed verify, stats now show `7 loop phases / 2 verify gates`.

### Changed
- `/bencium-verify` report now splits soft checks into "local" and "deployed-env (deferred)" blocks. Result line: `N PASS, N FAIL, N SKIP, N DEFERRED-TO-SMOKE`. Marking `[deployed]` rows `[x]` from local state is now a hard rule violation.
- `bencium-next.md` hard rules: BUILD will not edit implementation files without red observed; task is not done until local test passes AND any related `[deployed]` row passes against the live URL.
- Phase-banner skill: removed the "six-phase loop" framing — TEST (local) and SMOKE (deployed) are deliberately separate phases with distinct colors so the gap is visible.

### Fixed
- The Netlify-class false confirmation where a feature passed local verify, passed health check, and got logged as shipped without ever being exercised on the deployed env. Now structurally impossible: `[deployed]` rows cannot be checked off without live-URL evidence, and deploy refuses to run without `deploy.url` when those rows exist.

## May Gate — v0.2.0 (2026-05-23)

Added the mandatory plan/spec gate so the agent cannot jump into coding without showing you a reviewable plan first.

### Added
- **Two-phase `/bencium-next`** — Phase A (📋 PLAN, cyan, read-only) writes a 10–25 line plan/spec and waits for explicit user approval before Phase B (🔨 BUILD, green) executes.
- **`.harness/conventions.md`** — code-quality rules (file <800 LOC, shadcn/Tailwind preferences, token discipline, design-skill hints). Auto-loaded each session by `context-loader`.
- **`skills/phase-banner/SKILL.md`** — single source of truth for ANSI colors + Unicode banners + emoji per phase (PLAN cyan/📋, BUILD green/🔨, TEST yellow/✓, REFLECT magenta/💭, DEPLOY bright-blue/🚀).
- **`templates/next-moves.md.tmpl`** — structured end-of-loop suggestions with phase-progress strip and per-command "when / does / output" explanations.
- **Explicit `📝 Memory:` confirmation** after every action so you know exactly what landed in `.harness/memory.md`.
- Six-phase loop diagram printed by `/bencium-init`: `🗺️ roadmap → 📋 plan/spec → 🔨 build → ✓ test → 💭 reflect → 🚀 deploy`.

### Changed
- `/bencium-verify` and `/bencium-retro` now render `next-moves.md.tmpl` instead of improvising suggestions inline.
- `context-loader` skill now reads `.harness/conventions.md` on session start.

### Fixed
- `marketplace.json` version field was stuck at 0.1.0 after the 0.2.0 bump (this release also corrects that drift and refreshes the description).
